**Abstract:** Previous studies rarely consider the regional disparity in precipitation variability beyond the overall consistency in Northeast China (NEC). This study examines the spatial distribution and variability of spring precipitation in NEC, a critical region for grain production that is prone to precipitation-related natural disasters. Our results indicate that approximately 26.7% of spring precipitation events in NEC demonstrate a dipole pattern—characterized by contrasting precipitation distributions within the region—that is significantly influenced by low-pressure systems. Our analysis reveals a strong connection between these precipitation patterns and the preceding winter's sea ice conditions in the Kara Sea. Reduced sea ice leads to a decrease in Ural Mountain snow cover, lower surface albedo, and an increase in upward heat flux, thereby warming the lower atmosphere. This process weakens the meridional temperature gradient, slows the westerly jet stream, and intensifies cyclogenesis over NEC. Moreover, persistent anomalies in sea ice and snow cover drive the eastward movement of Rossby waves, shaping the “− + −” Eurasian teleconnection pattern that intensifies regional low-pressure systems. Consequently, these circulation patterns result in increased precipitation in northern NEC and decreased precipitation in the south. Additionally, numerical experiments using the CAM6.0 and LBM model were conducted to investigate the atmospheric response to sea ice loss and the subsequent dynamical mechanisms affecting precipitation in NEC. Therefore, variations in Kara Sea ice and Eurasia snow cover serve as predictive indicators for NEC's spring precipitation pattern, thereby enhancing our understanding of NEC's precipitation dynamics and providing vital insights for predicting and managing regional natural disasters.
